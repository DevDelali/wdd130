        <p>I am Paul, a Ghanaian by birth. I desire to live a life inspired by Jesus Christ, striving to fulfill His
            calling for
            me.
            In all this, I seek to become an outstanding software developer, creating applications that help with daily
            activities,
            assist ordinary people with simple services, and generate profit from my work.
            During my leisure time, I read books, watch movies with loved ones, and connect with others through
            socializing.

        <img src="images/capecoast.jpg" alt="Cape Coast castle, a Historic Fortress">
        <p>The castle was originally built by Swedes in 1653 and was later taken over by the Dutch and then the British.
            It is one of several forts and castles along the coast of Ghana that were built by European traders.
            Cape Coast Castle was a significant site during the transatlantic slave trade, serving as a holding area for
            enslaved
            people before they were shipped to the Americas. </p>
