        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Nyakey Paul" width="200">
        <p>Hello! My name is Nyakey Paul, and I‚Äôm from Ashaiman, Ghana. I enjoy reading non-fiction books and spend most of my time listening to audiobooks. 
        I have a strong interest in mathematics, which led me to develop a passion for studying programming languages. I discovered that programming is built
        on binary, a mathematical language made up of ones and zeros. This idea fascinates me and inspires my desire to explore the world of coding.

        Thanks to God Almighty, my dream of studying programming has come true. I am grateful for BYU Pathway, the online educational platform
        that has given me the chance to learn programming at a low cost. BYU Pathway offers simple and accessible course outlines, allowing me to 
        plan my day effectively. I can dedicate about 2 to 3 hours daily to studying, which helps me stay on track with my weekly assignments. 
        This flexibility makes learning enjoyable and manageable. I am excited about the journey ahead and look forward to developing my skills 
        further in programming, all while balancing my other interests.</p>

        <p> The Independence Arch in Accra, Ghana, is part of the Independence Square and was built in 1961 to commemorate Ghana's independence from British rule: 
            History. The arch was commissioned by Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah, for the visit of Queen Elizabeth II. 
            It represents Ghana's struggle for independence and honors the soldiers who died fighting for the country</p>
